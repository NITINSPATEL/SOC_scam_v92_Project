compare this with the actual available


3. Try to reason out the differences and
make a report regarding the same. The
report doesn't need to be very detailed,
but do include the architecture of the
model, libraries used, data source and
the process of loading the data, number
of epochs, batch size, plot of loss of
function against epochs, and also plot
the predicted prices with actual prices.
